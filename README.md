#How to play
1.In order to win you need to roll 100 points.
2."Current roll" shows how many points you rolled in one turn. Under "Player 1" and "Player 2" there is the amount of points gained in the whole game by a player.
3."Roll a dice" rolls a dice and shows the amount of gained points. You can roll as many times as you please, unless you roll 1. If you roll 1, you lose all of the points from your turn (the points stored in "Current roll")
4.Pressing the "Hold" button transfers your points from "Current roll" to your main score (you can't lose those points anymore) and changes the player.
5."Play again" restarts the game.
